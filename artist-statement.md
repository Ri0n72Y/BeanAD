# Artist Statement

I plan to make a small rhythm game, let customers have a short fun with beat of music. The original idea come from Rhythm Paradise, a Nintendo game on their devices. Audience play it with simply two buttons z and x interact with it, trying to hit at right timing with the background music beats.
The welcome screen design for a introduction, tell audience a simple interaction using z and x. Then the play the game. Player can press z button pushing a bean out of pod, and drop the empty pod by press x button. After the short game, they will see the advertisement selling the bean they "just make from pod".
The character called "bean guy" there to make the whole screen active and fun, where it is also the band character of the bean. The band of bean was not real but you could find similar things in supermarket.

The original plan has two stage, where the good beans will be selected to the cans and bad beans will be droped. Due to time and lack of technique, I just reach half of whole plan. There are some bugs like the arm would not back to right position which I spend a lot time trying to fix it, but perhaps it is a bug in animation design, hardly to repair unless refactor Animation module. All above were sad, but I hope you can have fun in my work!

PS: the very first screen is just a solution for chrome issue: I cannot play the bgm automatically when open the webpage, so I just put the page there almost meaningless, please ignore that from artwork!
