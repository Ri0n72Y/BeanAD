# Artist Statement

I plan to make a small rhythm game, let customers have a short fun with beat of music. The original idea come from Rhythm Paradise, a Nintendo game on their devices. Audience play it with simply two buttons z and x interact with it, trying to hit at right timing with the background music beats.
The welcome screen design for a introduction, tell audience a simple interaction time.
